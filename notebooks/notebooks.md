This directory contains notebook files used to separate exploratory work from the main source code. 

- EDA Notebooks: To analyze the raw and processed data, visualize trends, and identify patterns that help in building the model.
- Model Prototyping: Early-stage experimentation with different machine learning algorithms for predictive maintenance.
- Visualization Notebooks: Dedicated notebooks for visualizing results, such as predictive model outputs or comparisons between models.
- Reporting and Documentation Notebooks: Use notebooks to generate reports or share findings with the team
