<h1>Predictive Maintenance - Data Scientist Project using Time Series Forecasting</h1>

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>This project focuses on building a predictive maintenance model to predict machine Remaining User Life (RUL) using time-series sensor data. The goal is to anticipate when machines will fail, enabling proactive maintenance to minimize downtime and reduce costs. By leveraging historical sensor readings, error logs, failure events, and maintenance records, we aim to build a robust model capable of identifying early signs of failure.</p>

<h2>Dataset Summary</h2>
<p>The dataset used for this project contains sensor data, error logs, failure events, maintenance records, and machine metadata for 100 machines from 2014 to 2015. It is designed for Predictive Maintenance model building, providing insights into machine conditions and failure prediction.</p>

<h2>Key Questions We Aim to Solve</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Can an LSTM model accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of machines?</strong></li>
    <li><strong>How effective is the model in predicting future telemetry data (volt, rotate, pressure, vibration) using past telemetry sequences?</strong>
<p>By comparing the forecasted readings with historical failures, we aim to identify patterns that precede breakdowns.</p>
    </li>
</ol>
